Currently under development. Thanks for any contributions. Use the issue [github tracker](https://github.com/classroomtechtools/chat-adv-service/issues) for issues.

AppsScript doesn't have a native advanced service to interact with the Chat API. 

This one fills that gap.

To use:

- Create a service account that has access to Chat API
- Send the `privateKey` and `issuerEmail` to the `ChatService.init` method

Please [see documentation](https://classroomtechtools.github.io/chat-adv-service/).
